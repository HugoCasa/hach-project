# Is the Greta effect fake news?
> *If standing up against the climate and ecological breakdown and for humanity is against the rules, then the rules must be broken.* Greta Thunberg

- debate on climate change
- why are we focusing on climate change
- explain the greta effect
- what is before and after greta
- questions we're trying to answer: who is being quoted on climate change? what do they have in common? how are they saying what they are saying?
- What was greta's impact?

For years now climate change has been one of the dominating topics in public debate.
Since 2018 the "Friday for Future" movement has taken to the streets in an attempt to be heard by policy makers, led by a young woman from Sweden with a cardboard board.

We will show how the debate was dominated by certain groups of people over the years, how they have been speaking about climate change and what has changed since Greta Thunberg arrived on the stage. In order to quantify the changes, sentiment analysis and language complexity analyis was performed on quotes on climate change from the Quotebank dataset. We will analyze the two years before Greta took off as a person of public interest and the two years after. As she started protesting in Sweden in August of 2018, but newspapers really started paying attention to her in early 2019, we define 2017-2018 as the years before Greta (b.G.) and 2019-2020 are considered after Greta (a.G.). 

# Let's follow Greta Thunberg over the years

What's quite interesting about Greta Thunberg is that she isn't the typcal public speaker profile. To illustrate this, we have explored gender diversity and age distribution in the quotes concerning climate change over the years.

[plot_gender]

We only see a small increase in the percentage of women speakers throughout the years. But it basically stays around 20% which is far from being representative of the population. Note: other genders were also in the dataset but were insignificant and are therefore not visible on the graphs which shows again underrepresentation of those groups of people in the quoted speakers.

As can be seen from the graph, the sample of population speaking about climate change is rather old with a mean age of 56 years. The fact that Greta, 16 years old, speaks about it, is a game changer, as she stands out from the typical population in this context. We could wonder whether the movement is only aimed at old policy makers, or also at younger generations who will be the future policy makers and could therefore perdure the change.
Even though we see a peak at 21 years old, after some background checking, we've come to realise some inconsitencies in the wikidata and noticed that anyone older than 21, for whom we did not have age information were given the 21 label.
