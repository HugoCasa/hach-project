## 'If standing up against the climate and ecological breakdown and for humanity is against the rules, then the rules must be broken.'

For years now climate change has been one of the dominating topics in public debate.
Since 2018 the "Friday for Future" movement has taken to the streets in an attempt to be heard by policy makers, led by a young woman from Sweden with a cardboard board.
We will show how the debate was dominated by certain groups of people over the years, how they have been speaking about climate change and what has changed since Greta Thunberg arrived on the stage.
